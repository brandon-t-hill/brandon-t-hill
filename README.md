All my life, I have had a love for technology. All software and hardware fascinates me, from video games and consoles to datacenters and networks, learning how it works drives me. I spent time when I was young learning html and creating very basic websites. Later on I spent time learning to lua, though I don't think it stuck with me very well. I spent a year and a half on a path towards a computer science degree, learning c++ and some arm assembly. Finding myself unable to balance my mental health with the work of a college course load, I decided not to continue down that path. Now I am taking a backend software development bootcamp through Promineo Tech, where I am learning Java, MySql, and Springboot.

In my free time, I like playing video games and music. I primarily play the tenor saxophone, but am also familiar with piano and bass guitar. When I am able, I also produce my own music.
